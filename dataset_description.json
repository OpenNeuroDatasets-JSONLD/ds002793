	"Description": "Participants learned about novel fictional individuals whose behaviors were either internally inconsistent over time or internally consistent. The inconsistent individuals performed two or four same-valence behaviors, followed by two behaviors of the opposite valence. Participants gave trustworthiness ratings for every behavior on a scale from 1-7 (where 1=least trustworthy, 7=most trustworthy).",
